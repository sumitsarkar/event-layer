This module is heavily inspired from [Event Layer](https://github.com/kidGodzilla/event-layer). We have made it more configurable by providing more options on top of it.

## Inspiration

This Javascript package aims to remain a destination agnostic interface for all kinds of custom events generated in the browser when a user interacts with it. It's basically a router of events to different destinations.
